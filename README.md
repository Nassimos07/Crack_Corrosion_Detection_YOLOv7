# Corrosion and Crack Detection using YOLOv7

![Demo](demo.gif)

This repository contains code and resources for performing corrosion and crack detection using the YOLOv7 object detection algorithm. The aim of this project is to automatically detect and locate corrosion and cracks in images or videos, which can be valuable for infrastructure maintenance and safety assessments.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of various images and videos collected from different sources. You can find the dataset at [Crack dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/odd-han-outlook-com/contrast-tzvta)[https://universe.roboflow.com/trailrun/datasetnew-n7bra](Corrosion Dataset). It includes images depicting different scenarios and types of corrosion and cracks.

## Model and Algorithm
We utilized the YOLOv7 object detection algorithm for this project. YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model that is known for its accuracy and efficiency. The model was trained on the annotated dataset to detect and classify corrosion and cracks in images and videos.
